# Django Signal Database Transaction Behavior

Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller, which means any changes in the signal receiver are part of the same transaction as the changes in the code that triggered the signal.
If an error occurs in either the caller or the signal handler, the entire transaction will roll back, this behavior ensuring data consistency.

This example demonstrates that **Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller**.

## Overview

### Database Transaction Behavior:

1. When we create or modify an object, Django opens a transaction.
2. The `post_save` signal runs after the object has been saved, but within the same transaction as the caller by default.
3. If an error occurs in the signal handler after the save operation, both the changes made by the save method and those in the signal handler are rolled back.

## Run and Test

In the shell, try creating a UserProfile instance. After the signal error, weâ€™ll check if the instance was saved in the database:

```python
from users.models import UserProfile

# Try to create a user, which should trigger the signal
try:
    user = UserProfile.objects.create(username="testuser", email="testuser@example.com")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")

# Check if the user was saved despite the error
user_exists = UserProfile.objects.filter(username="testuser").exists()
print(f"Was the user saved? {user_exists}")
```
